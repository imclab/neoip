Yavipind is a secure tunnel aka 2 peers securely forwarding packets
toward each other.
It forwards any kind of packet (IPv4, IPv6 or other) sent over the virtual
point-to-point device (e.g. tun0).

<p> 
It runs in linux userspace (currently only 2.4.x kernel).

<hr> <h3>Yavipin features:</h3>
When designing the protocol and writting the software, the author
used the following criteria:
the security MUST as strong as reasonably possible, yavipin SHOULD be
network efficient, easy to use and install.
<h4>Network efficiency:</h4>
 <ul>
 <li> <b>small packet overhead:</b> 26bytes (e.g. ESP with DES+MD5 is 32byte)
 <li> <b>Packet compression:</b>
	Forwarded packets may be compressed using deflate (gzip).
	(WORK: add stat about efficiency)
 <li> <b>NAT compatible:</b>
	yavipin's tunnel may be establish over NAT as
	all packets of a tunnel are sent over a single UDP/IPv4 connection.
        Moreover the peer unreachability detection periodically send packets
        which prevent the NAT engine from timing out the connection state.
 <li> <b>Peer unreachabilty detection:</b>
        If the other peer becomes unreachable, it will be detected.
        It is done ala IPv6 neighbours discovery (rfc2461.7).
 <li> <b>Gracefull shutdown:</b>
        If a peer purposely stops, it will notify the other which is 
        immediatly aware of it.
 </ul>

<h4>Usage's simplicity:</h4>
 <ul>
 <li> <b>Fully in userspace:</b> No need to recompile the kernel
 <li> <b>reuse existing tools:</b>
        As yavipin use a virtual device, it is possible to apply to the
        tunnel any tool designed for network device. 
        For example, it is possible to set up a firewall using 
	ipchains/netfilter or to do traffic shapping using the 
	kernel's traffic control (see tc).
 </ul>

<h4>Security's strength:</h4>
 <ul>
 <li> <b>packet security:</b>
	each packet exchanged during the connection is encrypted using 
	blowfish CFB and authenticated with HMAC-MD5 96bits.
 <li> <b>protection against packet replay:</b>
	It uses strict anti-replay and no packet can be accepted twice.
	A eavedropper can't take a packet, keep it for a while and make
	it accept a second time by the destination.
 <li> <b>Efficient session key renewal:</b>
	It uses hash chains for efficiency. It allows smooth key transition
        not to cause any packet loss during the renewal.
        It provides forward secrecy inside the connection.
 <li> <b>Protect DoS ala TCP syn :</b>
	It uses cookie exchange (rfc2522.3) during the connection
	establishement. 
 <li> <b>Forward secrecy :</b>
        Even if the attacker cracks the box, he won't be able to decrypt
        network traffic older than a given delay (default 10min).
        The diffie-hellman private key and the session key are periodically
        renewed and securely erased from memory.
 </ul>

<hr> <h3>Yavipin portability:</h3>
Currently, yavipind has been tested only on linux-2.4 and will be ported
soon to linux-2.2.
To port it on another UNIX should be not too hard. The new OS must 
support openssl, glib and virtual tunnels. openssl and glib are
very portable and Universal TUN/TAP device
driver is supported by linux, solaris and freebsd. Any volunteer ?

<hr> <h3>Misc:</h3>
This page is rather short. it will hopefully become more complete later.
