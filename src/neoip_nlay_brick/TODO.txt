TODO task for the nlay brick:
-----------------------------
- the remaining brick to code are:
  - a cnxstat which count the raw data and the cooked data
    - a basic cnxstat_t counter is already implemented
  - a network coordinate system
    - with a space hooked in the profile_t context
--------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE:
  - to complete closure
    - i think the remaining is in the socket layer and not in the nlay one
  - a rate limiter for the connection
    - using the slidwin_t (need review)
    - call it rate_limit_t
    - using a rate estimator (call it rate_estim_t)
