# jme- helper executable to perform dns query honoring /etc/nsswitch.conf via fork()

# POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENT:
# - it may be made faster by a small C program, but would require a arch specific package
# - well a small exe to do that is not a real problem
# - so likely better to do it, but currently it is not a priority

# extract the HOSTNAME_TO_QUERY

# bash version relying on 'getent' (but getent which is bugged with ipv6 host:)

# TODO BUG BUG BUG
# - if the hostname requested support IPv6 this will resolve in ipv6 and make
#   it appears as a faillure
#   - force the resolution to IPv4
#   - e.g. no.releases.ubuntu.com resolve in IPv6
# ok now the code itself
# it output the list of ip address resulting of the resolution with a '/' at the end of each address
# if the resolution fails, it output nothing
# NOTE: the protocol of the output string is rather crappy for now. may be cleaned up latter
