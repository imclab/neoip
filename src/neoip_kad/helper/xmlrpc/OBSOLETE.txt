NOTE:
- this layer has been obsoleted during the refactorisation of the kad layer
  to remove the slot_id_t
- the new kad api make xmlrpc different
  - the work to restore it likely implies to handle a slot_id_t. to import
    the handler in the client
- i decided to drop kad_xmlrpc for now
  - PRO: this xmlrpc stuff is not high priority
  - CON: it keep xmlrpc in the running loop
