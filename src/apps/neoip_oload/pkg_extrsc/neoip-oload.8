.SH DESCRIPTION
neoip-oload is a deamon which allow to read files over the internet.
Those files may be static http content, .torrent content or .metalink content.

TODO this man page is just a stub. complete it
TODO put some example of usage
TODO document the httpo_ctrl rpc 

neoip-oload provides a crossdomain.xml file (a security policy file for flash player)
which allows every site to download external rescource thru neoip-oload. 

.SH about link type:
The links may be of various type:
static-type: when the content is a static file on top of http (currently http is the 
only supported protocol, later maybe other will be, e.g. https/ftp)
torrent-type: when the content is contained in the .torrent
metalink-type: when the content is contained in a .metalink

.SH limitation for outter uri 
outter uri are the uri used for static-http or dupuri. TODO: hue !?!? not true

The http server serving those uri MUST support range-request. 

If the uri of static-type do not support range-request, neoip-oload will detect
the case and simply replies a redirection on the inner-uri.

if the dupuri points to a http server not supporting range-request, it is simply
ignored (TODO to check)

It aims to support any retrieval http request on a static content. 
Here 'retrieval http request' means request using the GET method.
It support range requests.
