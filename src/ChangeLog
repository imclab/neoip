0.9.6 -- Feb 06 2002
- portability: support 2.2.x kernels
  o fall back to ethertap if compiled on 2.2.x kernel
- fixed a memory leak (Richard Jones <richard@earthmen.com>)

0.9.5 -- Nov 27 2001
- updated online help
- added --comp=algo to choose the compression algorightm function used
  to compress the packet
- DoS resistance: Changed the default udp port allocation. if the port 
  is unspecified, yavipin allocate a random unused one (using 
  /dev/urandom), it increase the DoS resistance. the additionnal
  security will likely be canceled if the initiator is behind a NAT box.
  o added ":dynamic" while specifiing udp port. It forces yavipin to use
    the kernel udp port allocation (aka make it easy to predic). 
    it SHOULD not be used. it is an debug option
- configuration: simplified the address binding. the only requirement
  is to specify the destination address for a initiator. all the other
  cases may be done automatically if the admin doesnt explicitly specify
  them.

0.9.4 -- Nov 22 2001
- added GPL in the source
- added long options for the command line (short option no more supported)
- added --enc=algo and --mac=algo to choose the block cipher and the mac
  function used once the tunnel is established.

0.9.3 -- Nov 18 2001
- fixed a bug in setting the virtual device MTU
- minor improvements in error reporting

0.9.2 -- Nov 16 2001
- for forward secrecy, periodically renew the diffie hellman secret
  o even if the attacker cracks the box, he won't be able to read
    traffic older than YAV_AUTH_NEW_DH_PRIV (as skey renewal is shorter)
  o the period is YAV_AUTH_NEW_DH_PRIV (default 10min)
- update the web docs
- use the libc daemon() instead of my own
- source beautifullication (rename cert by auth)

0.9.1 -- Nov 14 2001
