\par TODO refactor bt_peerpick_vapi_t init
- all the init of bt_peerpick_vapi_t is crappy
- the profile of *EACH* implementation is in bt_ezswarm_profile_t
  - so less flexible
- the bt_swarm_sched_full_t is notified of the bt_peerpick_vapi_t is notified
  of the bt_peerpick_vapi_t pointer by a tech bypassing everything
  - so easy to forget to set it up
  - dirty code while setting it up
  - POSSIBLE SOLUTION: have event with register ?
    - but this is the only event and there is only one bt_peerpick_vapi_t to register
    - so seems overkill

- the ctor of bt_peerpick_vapi_t is crappy
- many bt_peerpick_vapi_t function are similar, or even identical, from one impl to another
  - so have a helper which centralize the similar logic
  - DONE in bt_peerpick_helper_t
