this tls layer is a wrapper on top of gnutls
- it act as a filter. aka no network connection is done by this layer
- it is halfback because it is not tunable
  - it is because i currently dont understand what are the option for tls
- it has been a bit tested
  - successfull: establish a client connection toward a https server (see nunit2)
  - successfull: in memory connection toward a cert tls_resp_t. 
  - successfull: establish an anonymous connection toward a anonymous tls server
    - see  ex-serv-anon in gnutls example
  - successfull: establish anonymous connection between tls_itor_t and tls_resp_t
    in memory only (see nunit)
