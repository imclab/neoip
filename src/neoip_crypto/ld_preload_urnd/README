ld_preload_urnd is standealone. not directly linked to neoip. it is
a LD_PRELOAD trick to redir open(/dev/random) to open(/dev/urandom)

It is about working around 2 bugs
- some ubuntu limitation on /dev/random pool size
- gnutls being forced to use /dev/random and not /dev/urandom

without this trick, creating an identity may be VERY long (as in a few minutes)
aka completly unusable.
